# Predict-Housing-Prices
Multivariate Linear Regression

Suppose you are selling your house and you want to know what a good market price would be. One way to do this is to first collect information on recent houses sold and make a model of housing prices. Your job is to predict housing prices based on other variables.

The file ex1data2.txt contains a training set of housing prices in Portland, Oregon. The first column is the size of the house (in square feet), the second column is the number of bedrooms, and the third column is the price of the house.

We want to predict price for the data of houses given in predict_price.txt
